## Here I take the string and do a simple for loop which count only the wrong place of character
in if statement this => if(s[i]-'a'!=i) s[i] - 'a' will return the arrange of letters in alphabet.

## By logic if there is no wring with the arrange the problem is ok, if two letters in the wrong arrange so I can edit them one time which the problem is ok... otherwise the output will be 'no'
